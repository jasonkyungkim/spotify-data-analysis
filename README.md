# Personalized Spotify Listening Report

I was always thought it was weird how Spotify would release listening data only on an annual basis, so I created my personal report template using Spotify's web API. If you want to use this youserlf, all you need to is to set some environemnt variables on your local machine and simply run the script from your terminal.
